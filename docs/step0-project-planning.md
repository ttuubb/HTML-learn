# Python Learning Website Project Planning

## Project Overview

According to the design proposal, we will develop a fully-functional Python learning website, including four core modules: course learning, code practice, online editor, and learning progress tracking. This document outlines the overall planning and implementation steps of the project.

## Technology Stack Selection

After evaluation, we have chosen the following technology stack:

- **Backend Framework**: Django (compared to Flask, Django provides a more complete feature set, including built-in admin panel, authentication system, etc.)
- **Frontend Template**: Django Templates + Bootstrap 5 (responsive design)
- **Online Editor**: CodeMirror (lightweight, easy to integrate)
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production environment
- **Deployment**: Nginx + Gunicorn

## Project Completion Steps

The project will be completed in the following 6 main steps:

### Step 1: Project Initialization and Architecture Setup

- Create Django project and applications
- Configure basic settings (database, static files, etc.)
- Design basic templates and styles
- Implement user authentication system
- Create basic navigation and homepage

**Estimated Time**: 1 week

### Step 2: Course Learning Module Implementation

- Design course data models (categories, courses, chapters, etc.)
- Implement course content management
- Develop course browsing and learning interface
- Implement quiz functionality
- Integrate rich text editor

**Estimated Time**: 2 weeks

### Step 3: Code Practice Module Implementation

- Design practice problem data models (difficulty, type, test cases, etc.)
- Implement practice problem management system
- Develop code submission and evaluation functionality
- Implement practice problem browsing and filtering
- Design test case system

**Estimated Time**: 2 weeks

### Step 4: Online Editor Module Implementation

- Integrate CodeMirror editor
- Implement code execution environment
- Develop code formatting functionality
- Implement code snippet saving functionality
- Add syntax highlighting and error prompting

**Estimated Time**: 1.5 weeks

### Step 5: Learning Progress Tracking Module Implementation

- Design user progress data models
- Implement course learning progress tracking
- Develop practice problem completion records
- Implement notes and favorites functionality
- Design user personal center

**Estimated Time**: 1.5 weeks

### Step 6: Project Deployment and Launch

- Configure production environment database
- Set up Nginx and Gunicorn
- Implement static file optimization
- Configure SSL certificate
- Conduct performance testing and optimization
- Write deployment documentation

**Estimated Time**: 1 week

## Project Timeline

The overall project is expected to be completed in about 9 weeks, with the specific timeline as follows:

1. **Week 1**: Complete project initialization and architecture setup
2. **Weeks 2-3**: Complete course learning module
3. **Weeks 4-5**: Complete code practice module
4. **Weeks 6-7**: Complete online editor module
5. **Weeks 7-8**: Complete learning progress tracking module
6. **Week 9**: Complete project deployment and launch

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Technical Risk**: Security of online code execution environment
   - Mitigation: Implement strict sandbox environment and resource limitations

2. **Schedule Risk**: Some modules may take more time than expected
   - Mitigation: Set reasonable buffer time, adjust feature priorities if necessary

3. **Integration Risk**: Issues may arise when integrating different modules
   - Mitigation: Adopt incremental development and continuous integration methods to identify issues early

## Future Extension Plans

After completing the basic functionality, the following extensions can be considered:

1. Implement learning notes export functionality
2. Add custom practice problem functionality
3. Develop mobile-adapted version
4. Provide RESTful API interfaces
5. Integrate third-party login

## Conclusion

This project plan provides a roadmap for implementing the Python learning website, clearly defining the tasks and time arrangements for each step. By following this plan, we will be able to complete the project development in an orderly manner and ultimately deliver a fully-functional, user-friendly Python learning platform.
